        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafloor_spreading" title="Sea-floor spreading Wikipedia">Seafloor spreading</a> is a process where new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_crust" title="Oceanic Crust Wikipedia">oceanic crust</a> is formed through volcanic activity that gradually moves away from the ridge. 
        A model is a 3d representation of an object or process that is usually demonstrated on a smaller scale.

        The activity that was used to model <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafloor_spreading" title="Sea-floor spreading Wikipedia">sea-floor spreading</a> demonstrates the process of the creation and recycling of the sea floor. 
        To model the process we used long coloured strips of paper that depicted the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabed" title="Sea Floor Wikipedia">seafloor</a> with colours to help us see the sea-floor age overtime. 
        Sea Floor spreading occurs when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma" title="Magma Wikipedia">magma</a> erupts from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rift_valley" title="Rift Valley Wikipedia">rift valley</a> and cools straight away. 
        Over time, the rock is pushed away as it gets older. 
        This is demonstrated when the strips of paper are pushed up through the centre also known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rift_valley" title="Rift Valley Wikipedia">rift valley</a>. 
        The strips portray the magma when it comes out of the volcano and how the older the piece gets, the further away it gets from the middle. 
        The different colours on the strip also help people to visually track the sea-floor. As a result, the strips of paper visually represent the creation of the sea-floor.

        Additionally, the process of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction" title="Subduction Wikipedia">subduction</a>that occurs in seafloors is displayed. 
        The strips of paper that go in between the slits on either side of the rift valley exhibit the geological process of subduction. 
        Subduction occurs when two plates collide the more dense plate sinks under that creates volcanoes, trenches and subduction zones. 
        This old rock that has sunk melts and is recycled into new magma. 
        This process of subduction is displayed when the paper goes under the slits. 
        Therefore, the model represents the process of subduction and sea-floor spreading.
